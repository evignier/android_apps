# Tuta Mail overview
Tutanota (often referred to as Tuta Mail) is a secure email service that emphasizes privacy and security. It offers end-to-end encryption for emails by default, meaning that only the sender and recipient can read the messages.

# Why I need it
As I started using my smartphone without Google Services I found out that push notifications (real-time notifications like instant messaging or email messages) very often rely on FCM.

Firebase Cloud Messaging, which is free of cost, is a service provided by Google that allows developers to send notifications to users. That involves sending user data to Google's servers for notifications delivery.

Tuta Mail has its own secure notification system that doesn't rely on FCM. And they don't require a phone number to use their service.

I prefer to avoid alternatives that scan email and notifications content. Profiling refers to the process of collecting and analyzing data about individuals to create a detailed profile or representation of their behaviors, preferences, interests, and characteristics.
