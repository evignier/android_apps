# Syncthing Overview
- Syncthing is an open-source tool that lets you securely continously sync files between multiple devices without using cloud storage. It connects your devices directly over the internet or local network, keeping your files private and under your control.
- Sadly, the Android app is discontinued, with the final release in December 2024. The discontinuation is due to challenges with Google Play publishing and a lack of active maintenance.
## Why I need Syncthing
- I needed a way to sync files (books, notes, media) between my devices without relying on a third-party cloud provider. Lacking the time and knowledge to set up Nextcloud on my Raspberry Pi, I found Syncthing to be the easiest solution. I initially synced my Android tablet and phone, and later figured out how to make it work on a Linux system without a GUI.
