# Simplelogin overview
SimpleLogin is an email aliasing service that allows users to create unique email addresses (aliases) to protect their real email addresses from spam and enhance privacy.

It forwards emails sent to these aliases to the user's actual inbox, helping to manage and secure online communications without revealing personal information.

# Why I need it
Using different aliases for each service helps me protect my privacy by keeping my real email address hidden and reducing spam. It gives me control to manage and delete specific aliases. This way, I can compartmentalize my online activities, maintain digital hygiene by cleaning up unused accounts, and stay minimalist by only registering for services I truly need.
