## Obtainium Overview
Obtainium allows you to install and update Android apps directly from their "source" websites by automating the process, and receive notifications when new releases are made available.
## Why I need Obtainium
I appreciate to download, install, and update apps without needing to create an account, which adds a layer of convenience and privacy. I prefer using open source alternatives that provide APKs on platforms like github or official websites while I avoid proprietary apps that are exclusive to the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.
